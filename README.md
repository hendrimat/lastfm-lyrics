## Setup

You also need to create an [API account](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) on Last.fm to get an API key.

## Usage
Can be used with any music player that has scrobbling support.

1. Insert your Last.fm username and API keys into the script
2. Execute the script in your terminal '$ python PATH/TO/SCRIPT'
